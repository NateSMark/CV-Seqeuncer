# CV-Seqeuncer
ATmega 4809 program for a control voltage sequencer prototype.

This is long term project in-the-works--the first phase of which (the current state) was wrapped up in a very short time--so please
forgive discrepancies in style and documentation!

Credit is owed to S. Farnsworth, A. Bunker, P. Fitzpatrick, and Hanna Thayyil (and Mike Borish for facilitating the project), although design of the bulk of the actual sequencer was almost exclusively my work. 

# Hardware:
- ATmega 4809 Curiosity Nano development board
- Microchip MCP4922 12-bit DAC
- Winbond W25Q32JV Serial Flash
